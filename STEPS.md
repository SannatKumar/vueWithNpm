Creating a new laravel project

$ composer create-project laravel/laravel --prefer-dist laravel-vue-spa

Install the Vue JS inside.

$ composer require laravel/ui

Integrate the Vue JS into Laravel project.

$ php artisan ui vue

compile the Vue whenever we make any changes

$ npm install && npm run dev

Because in SPA thereâ€™s a route where users can navigate to any pages they want, we need to install an additional library, the Vue Router.

$ npm install vue-router
